This adds support to Sequelize for MySQL’s `TIMESTAMP` data type. Specifically, it allows you to use `TIMESTAMP` for basic storage of an absolute date/time.

It works with Sequelize 3.x and pre-release version 4.x.

## Why use it

MySQL has two data types for dates and times: `TIMESTAMP` and `DATETIME`. There are tradeoffs with either type; [see below](#differences-between-timestamp-and-datetime). Sequelize has built-in support for `DATETIME` but limited support for `TIMESTAMP`.

Currently the main reason to use `TIMESTAMP` is to support legacy DB schemas.

## Usage

**Install:** `npm install sequelize-mysql-timestamp`

```javascript
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');

// create your connection
const sequelize = new Sequelize(…);

// now add the TIMESTAMP type
const TIMESTAMP = require('sequelize-mysql-timestamp')(sequelize);

const User = sequelize.define('User', {
  username: Sequelize.STRING,
  hire_date: TIMESTAMP
});
```

## Use a Date or an epoch integer

When setting a date value, it’s recommended that you pass a `Date` object, or a plain integer (an epoch timestamp—what you get when you call `Date.now()`). You can also pass any object whose numeric value resolves to an epoch timestamp, including Moment.js objects.

Although you can pass a string, this is not recommended, as string values don’t inherently have timezone information. Without a timezone your string may be interpreted as a local date, unless it’s a date-only ISO 8601 string (see the [note regarding `dateString` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)). Some date strings do have timezone information but even then, to avoid inconsistent parsing, it’s strongly recommended that you pass a timezone-aware value, either a `Date()`, or an epoch timestamp (which is by definition UTC), or a Moment.js object.

If you pass a string value, a warning will be printed to the console. To suppress this warning, pass `{ warnings: false }` to the constructor:

```
const TIMESTAMP = require('sequelize-mysql-timestamp')(sequelize, { warnings: false });
```

## The `$between` keyword in Sequelize

When using the Sequelize `$between` keyword, Sequelize will **not** properly pass the value through this data type. Instead, it’s best to pass string values. The strings should represent the desired times in UTC:

```
  SomeModel.findAll({ where: { hire_date: { $between: [ '2016-01-01 00:00:00', '2016-01-31 23:59:59' ] }}})…
```

## Differences between `TIMESTAMP` and `DATETIME`

The MySQL `TIMESTAMP` data type stores a [Unix epoch timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). This represents an _absolute_ instant in time, regardless of timezones, which is great for data consistency. On the other hand, a `TIMESTAMP` can only represent values between January 1970 and January 2038, which is a serious limitation for some apps.

By contrast, `DATETIME` is stored without any timezone. It can represent any date/time from 1000-9999 AD, but without a timezone, _there is no way to know what moment a `DATETIME` represents_. For a `DATETIME` column to be meaningful you must decide in advance what timezone to use (hopefully UTC unless your DB designers are nuts). This isn’t stored in the database, it’s just a convention. Make sure all your programmers are aware of this, and that data is always converted to/from the desired timezone. Sequelize does this with its [`timezone`](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/api/sequelize/#new-sequelizedatabase-usernamenull-passwordnull-options) option.

### Conclusion

You can choose `TIMESTAMP`, which represents a specific time regardless of local timezone settings, but only a limited range of dates. Or you can choose `DATETIME`, which represents a wide range of dates, but requires all your programmers and applications to consistently convert to/from an agreed-upon timezone.

The SQL standard defines a data type, `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, that supports a wide range of dates, and because it has an explicit timezone, represents a non-ambiguous moment in time. This is widely supported in other database engines: PostgreSQL and Oracle support `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`; Microsoft SQL Server has a similar `DATETIMEOFFSET`. Unfortunately MySQL doesn’t have anything like it. `TIMESTAMP` and `DATETIME`, with their respective limitations, are your only options.

## Tests

To run the unit tests, copy `test/config.js` to `test/config.local.js` and enter credentials for a test database. Then run `npm test`.

During the tests, several tables are created. These have names starting with `_test_timestamp_` followed by a UUID, so they will not conflict with existing tables. These tables are `DROP`ped after the tests.

The tests use Sequelize 5.x, the latest supported version. To test against other versions, do `npm rm sequelize && npm i -D sequelize@4` before running the test. Replace `@4` with the version you want to test against. Tests should work back to Sequelize v3.
